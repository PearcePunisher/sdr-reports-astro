                The 2020s are marked by the digitization of health care and
                wellness, from telehealth online doctor visits to
                subscription-based fitness trackers like Whoop and Oura that
                provide consumers with access to health and lifestyle data that
                is collected 24/7. Following this digitization and
                consumerization of health and wellness, acquirers are
                increasingly looking for technologies that bridge the gap
                between medical diagnostic tools and consumer devices. <sup

              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Online, health and wellness influencers are finding engaged
                audiences, and marketers have noticed as influencers reach
                younger, more free-spending generations while promoting healthy
                lifestyles, mental health self-care, even diet and nutrition.
                Fueled by marketing, functional food and beverage products that
                allow consumers to integrate wellness into everyday habits have
                exploded in popularity. Perhaps the most notable example of this
                is probiotic sodas such as Olipop and Poppi, brands that have
                successfully disrupted the soda market by positioning their
                sodas as digestive health products. <sup>[2]</sup>
              </li>
              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Med spas and aesthetic clinics, which offer services such as
                Botox and Red Light Therapy, have become resilient sub-sectors
                in M&A because they operate high-margin businesses on a cash-pay
                basis, bypassing the headaches of insurance reimbursement.
                Coupled with growing demand, including from younger consumers
                looking for preventative aging solutions, private equity is
                increasingly active in consolidating the space. <sup>[3]</sup>

              Telehealth, wearables, supplements, and self-care needs appear to
              be driving a renewed wellness market. <sup>[4]</sup>
            </p>
            <div class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Since Apple’s App Store named the self-care category its “trend of
              the year” in 2018, self-care has grown into a $1.8 trillion global
              market, including spas, exercise, personal care and beauty,
              wellness tourism, and biomonitoring. <sup>[5]</sup>
            </div>

            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Meanwhile, digital healthcare, whether on-screen or on your body,
              may bethe future of care. The National Institutes of Health
              reports “Healthcare is undergoing a profound transformation driven
              by digital solutions,” including AI and conversational agents such
              as ChatGPT reshaping the way care is delivered. Remote care models
              – including skin scanning apps, remote monitoring, biomarker data
              analysis, smart scales, and even smart toilets – threaten to upend
              care as we’ve known it for decades. <sup>[5,6]</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Even more intriguing than how we connect with care is the drive to
              self-care built on DIY monitoring and online influencer
              encouragement. And there is an emerging trend, attracting younger
              people, of getting “baby Botox” injections to smooth skin and blur
              even the hint of a wrinkle. This isn’t the traditional middle aged
              or older crowd yearning to look a little younger, these are people
              in their 20s and 30s seeking micro treatments, maybe a few times a
              year, and willing to pay north of $400 for a quick tune up. <sup

              The number of so-called “med spas,” where clients can mix and
              mingle traditional spa treatments with medical injections and
              laser hair removal, were up more than 200% from 2010 to 2023, and
              that number is growing. Think of it as going to the nail salon for
              a mani-pedi, along with a Botox injection. Are there doctors, or
              even medically trained professionals, in these strip-mall spots?
              Maybe - it depends on individual state rules. Regardless of the
              regulatory environment, investors are flocking to the highly
              fragmented, cash payment, recurrent revenue wild west in the $30
              billion “medical aesthetics” market. <sup>[11,12]</sup>

              are the younger Gen Z and Millennial generations who are both

              Marketers and brands have noticed the overall interest in health
              and wellness expanding beyond traditional wellness products to
              other areas including food, beauty, workplace benefits, even
              financial products. Fancy a shot of “functional nutrition” with
              turmeric, ginger, or extra protein on your next visit to
              Starbucks? The coffee king added these to the menu in 2025. When
              nearly 85% of Americans say wellness is a “top” priority, no
              marketer (or acquirer) can resist. Nutrition, sleep, mental
              wellbeing, beauty, fitness, and health all fit neatly under the
              wellness umbrella. Food and beverage makers have stepped right in
              to promote and label offerings as high protein and fiber rich,
              while a new class of companies have emerged that take a legacy,
              often "unhealthy" staple, and re-engineering it with a specific
              benefit. In the Olipop and Poppi example above, these companies
              have positioned a "vice" (soda) as a "virtue" (digestive health).
              This proved fruitful for more than just consumer gut health. In
              May of 2025, Poppi was acquired by PepsiCo for $1.95 billion,
              providing strong returns for the brand’s private equity backers. <sup
