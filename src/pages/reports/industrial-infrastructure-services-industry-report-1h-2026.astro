              The U.S. power grid infrastructure is increasingly straining to

              rapid buildup and use of the data centers fueling an AI
              revolution. The grid’s in trouble. One tracking service reported
              336 major power outages last year – counting only those affecting
              at least 50,000 people each time – totaling 7,700 hours in the
              U.S. Power outages are on the rise compared to prior years.<sup

              Experts agree, the grid needs an upgrade. It’s estimated American
              power companies alone spent $208 billion in 2025 on the nation’s
              power grid with predictions that number will total more than $1
              trillion over the next five year. Companies in the middle market,
              those that the power companies are paying to provide the mission
              critical services required to upgrade and maintain the grid, are
              benefitting. With this increased demand, profits are rising and,

              Think a national power grid can’t just “go down” without
              attention? The risk is real – and it’s why US companies – and the
              government – are willing to open their checkbooks. It was an
              ordinary day in April of 2025 when both Spain and Portugal went
              dark in an outage blamed on grid “cascading overvoltage,” the
              system wasn’t robust enough. Electric trains stopped, people were
              stuck in elevators, and everything ceased for tens of millions of
              people for up to 10 hours. In the fall of 2024, millions in the
              South American country of Ecuador – with a grid that depends
              disproportionally on hydroelectric power – endured months of daily
              blackouts lasting eight to 12 hours as hydro plant reservoirs went
              dry and old, inefficient equipment couldn’t keep up. Across
              Ecuador’s cities, traffic lights stopped working, nighttime
              streetlights went out, cell phones quit as signal towers ran out
              of juice, and the air filled with smoke and the sound of rattling

              In short, aging electrical infrastructure is a real problem. PG&E,
              the California grid giant, has been repeatedly blamed for its
              aging infrastructure sparking deadly and catastrophic wildfires.
              The company recently agreed to a $100 million settlement with
              shareholders who alleged the company misled them about its
              wildfire prevention and safety protocols. That award was on top of
              tens of millions in penalties it’s paid for its role in earlier
              massively destructive wildfires. In Colorado, the state’s biggest
              electric service provider Xcel Energy has repeatedly turned off
              parts of its grid causing blackouts during high wind warnings to
              prevent aging power lines from igniting wildfires. Grids get old.<sup

              Then there’s demand. For the past 20 years, U.S. electrical demand
              remained relatively consistent. When new AI technologies ignited
              massive demands in 2022, planners were caught unprepared. The grid
              wasn’t ready for the wave of AI data centers and the speed at
              which corporations and everyday Americans would incorporate
              gigawatt guzzling AI applications. By the end of 2026, it’s been
              estimated power demands for the world’s AI data centers may exceed
              1,000 terawatt-hours, making data centers alone the world’s fifth
              largest consumer of power – a demand estimated to be between that
              of all of Japan and all of Russia. Northern Virginia, dubbed “Data
              Center Alley,” in 2025 handled 70% of global internet traffic, and
              the power company that supplies the area is struggling to meet
              demand as old plants go offline faster than new ones are built
              while consumer rates rise. And that AI power demand isn’t
              replacing other uses, it’s on top of other increases spurred by
              electric vehicle use, heat pumps, electrified manufacturing, and

              Anyone who’s been around since 2019 has seen how global trade can
              be disrupted by global events outside of U.S. borders. Supply
              chain disruptions, trade differences, and geopolitical tensions
              are a part of life. But American businesses have shown they can
              react and adapt. When a 2020-21 global computer chip disruption
              upended the production of everything from consumer tech to autos,
              a focus on bringing chip production onshore sparked a
              manufacturing renaissance, turning Phoenix into a semiconductor
              hub. It hasn’t been easy, while once manufacturers were fine with
              chips made in other countries where the permitting process is
              quick and the rules scarce, the burgeoning homegrown industry has
              spent tens of millions meeting U.S. regulations and navigating
              18,000 new rules. Rebuilding an aging power grid – from new energy
              production to reinvestment in power transmission repair and
              maintenance – won’t be easy either, but necessity has a way of
              finding invention and investment. In one case, Microsoft’s
              inventive solution to provide for data center power demands has
              been to pay to reactivate a dormant nuclear reactor at Three Mile
              Island. It’s off to a rocket start as the project was fast-tracked
              and is set to restart in 2027. Homemade solution.

              Hardening and expanding the grid will require a concerted effort
              and a raft of components and materials. But it’s happening.

              while others turn to acquisition as a way to increase human

              While building a full-scale, consumer-focused power plant is the
              province of giants considering the amount of capital pouring into
              projects to address grid needs, there is room for middle and small
              market providers, too. And a push for more, and more dependable,
              electrical power doesn’t feel like it’s simply a four- or
              five-year “catchup.” Global consultant and researcher McKinsey &
              Co. sets the bar pretty high, predicting a $23 trillion global
              spend on energy and power infrastructure, including maintenance,
              by 2040.36

              Substation maintenance is a growing sector that enjoys repeatable,
              reliable revenue investors and buyers like to see in a business.
              The U.S. electrical cable maintenance market is, by one estimate,
              seen growing from $13.5 billion today to $24.6 billion by 2036, a
              6.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Installation and
              maintenance of smart grid sensors (“the eyes and ears of the power
              grid”) are seen as indispensable services. Utility vegetation
              managers are those crews that prune tree limbs away from power
              lines and provide right-of-way mowing and upkeep. Clearing trees
              from power lines is considered so vital the practice is embedded
              in federal regulations. Sprawling data centers require a
              tremendous amount of cooling, sparking a boom in private equity
              acquisition interest in the contracted, and highly fragmented,
              HVAC sector. Data centers are also sparking interest in
              contractors who specialize in electrical efficiency and
              maximization services.

                There are indications that infrastructure development is riding
                a wave heading into 2026. There’s consumer and industrial-level
                demand for reliable power, there’s money available to spend, and
                there are pressures to keep up with rising demand while
                maintaining safe, efficient production and delivery. In addition
                to demand, investors are watching potential weather and

                the grid,” again creating investment opportunities in the sector
                including materials, engineering, and design. For existing
                investors, exits in the past years have been slower than normal,
                but there are indications deal flow will increase with activity
                reaching the middle-market buyers and sellers sparking interest
                not just at the top but in secondary and grid adjacent fields.

                From a business ownership standpoint, we are in an interesting
                era. Some 3 million small business – as many as 50%,
                representing about $10 trillion in value – in the U.S. are owned
                by the aging Baby Boomer generation, a generation that has spent
                a lifetime building businesses, many in the skilled trades and
                services that industry and infrastructure depend on. As they get
                into their senior years, owners may be approaching an exit.
                Hundreds of thousands of Boomers in the U.S. sell a business
                each year. The youngest of the generation turns 62 this year.
                And “handing down” a business to an adult child may not be the
                option it once was as younger generations have enjoyed a larger
                variety of career options than their parents and are trending
                out of the trades in favor of other areas including healthcare
                and tech. That may create the space where a willing buyer and a
                willing seller come together.<sup

              Private equity has been experiencing longer holding periods
              compared to past data. Higher interest rates – by historical
              standards – may have been a factor. But rates have come down, and
              if the Fed continues with anticipated rate cuts in 2026, we can
              expect an uptick in deal flow, especially as private equity
              investors who have held for seven or eight years get ready to
              gather profits and seek new acquisition targets. The PE exit
              logjam may be on the verge of what some are calling “The Great
              Unlocking.” For entrepreneurs who have built a successful
              business, we believe preparation is vital when buyers come
              looking. Working with a team of professionals can ensure sellers
              know whether an offer is one they can’t refuse or shouldn’t
              accept. Knowing the value of a business, it’s demonstrated
              profitability, it’s repeatable business model, and understanding
              the array of potential deal structures can help owners make smart
              decisions when it’s time for the next chapter. Being prepared is
              better than being caught flat footed, and in an uncertain world of
              rapid changes – say an inflationary rebound and return to interest
              rate hikes – could shut the door unexpectedly. In the coming year,
              we believe those who understand the investment climate and are
              ready and prepared to answer that knock at the door may find
              opportunity on the other side.<sup
