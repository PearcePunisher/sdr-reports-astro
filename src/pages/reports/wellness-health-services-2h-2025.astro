                The 2020s are marked by the digitization of health care and
                wellness, from telehealth online doctor visits to
                subscription-based fitness trackers like Whoop and Oura that
                provide consumers with access to health and lifestyle data that is
                collected 24/7.
              </li>
              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Following this digitization and consumerization of health and
                wellness, acquirers are increasingly looking for technologies that
                bridge the gap between medical diagnostic tools and consumer
                devices.
              </li>
              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Online, health and wellness influencers are finding engaged
                audiences, and marketers have noticed as influencers reach
                younger, more free-spending generations while promoting healthy
                lifestyles, mental health self-care, even diet and nutrition.
              </li>
              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Fueled by marketing, functional food and beverage products that
                allow consumers to integrate wellness into everyday habits have
                exploded in popularity. Perhaps the most notable example of this
                is probiotic sodas such as Olipop and Poppi, brands that have
                successfully disrupted the soda market by positioning their sodas
                as digestive health products.
              </li>
              <li class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                Med spas and aesthetic clinics, which offer services such as Botox
                and Red Light Therapy, have become resilient sub-sectors in M&A
                because they operate high-margin businesses on a cash-pay basis,
                bypassing the headaches of insurance reimbursement. Coupled with
                growing demand, including from younger consumers looking for
                preventative aging solutions, private equity is increasingly
                active in consolidating the space.

              Telehealth, wearables, supplements, and self-care needs appear to
              be driving a renewed wellness market. Since Apples App Store named
              the self-care category its trend of the year in 2018, self-care
              has grown into a $1.8 trillion global market, including spas,
              exercise, personal care and beauty, wellness tourism, and
              biomonitoring.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Meanwhile, digital healthcare, whether on-screen or on your body,
              may be the future of care. The National Institutes of Health
              reports Healthcare is undergoing a profound transformation driven
              by digital solutions, including AI and conversational agents such
              as ChatGPT reshaping the way care is delivered. Remote care models
              including skin scanning apps, remote monitoring, biomarker data
              analysis, smart scales, and even smart toilets threaten to upend
              care as weve known it for decades.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Even more intriguing than how we connect with care is the drive to
              self-care built on DIY monitoring and online influencer
              encouragement. And there is an emerging trend, attracting younger

              are the younger Gen Z and Millennial generations who are both

              Marketers and brands have noticed the overall interest in health
              and wellness expanding beyond traditional wellness products to
              other areas including food, beauty, workplace benefits, even
              financial products. Fancy a shot of functional nutrition with

              When nearly 85% of Americans say wellness is a top priority, no
              marketer (or acquirer) can resist. Nutrition, sleep, mental
              wellbeing, beauty, fitness, and health all fit neatly under the
              wellness umbrella. Food and beverage makers have stepped right in
              to promote and label offerings as high protein and fiber rich,
              while a new class of companies have emerged that take a legacy,
              often "unhealthy" staple, and re-engineering it with a specific
              benefit. In the Olipop and Poppi example above, these companies
              have positioned a "vice" (soda) as a "virtue" (digestive health).
              This proved fruitful for more than just consumer gut health. In
              May of 2025, Poppi was acquired by PepsiCo for $1.95 billion,
              providing strong returns for the brands private equity backers.
